This project is a chatbot powered by **OpenRouter**. It's designed to provide conversational responses using various large language models (LLMs) available through the OpenRouter API.

### üîë Setting up the API Key

This project requires an API key from OpenRouter to access its models. You'll use this key to authenticate your chatbot's requests.

1.  Go to the [OpenRouter website](https://openrouter.ai/) and sign in or create an account.
2.  Navigate to your **API Keys** section.
3.  Click on **Create Key** to generate a new API key.
4.  Give your key a descriptive name and optionally set a credit limit.
5.  **Copy the generated key immediately\!** You will not be able to see it again after you leave the page.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploying on Render

Render is a great platform for deploying web services like this chatbot. You'll use your OpenRouter API key as an environment variable to keep it secure.

1.  Create a new Web Service on Render and connect your GitHub repository.
2.  In the deployment settings, look for the **Environment** section.
3.  Add a new environment variable:
      * **Key**: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (or the variable name your code uses)
      * **Value**: Paste the API key you copied from OpenRouter here.

This setup ensures your secret key is not exposed in your codebase and is only accessible by the deployed application. After a successful deployment, you'll get a public URL for your chatbot. You can find this URL in your Render dashboard, and you can now use it to interact with your chatbot.
