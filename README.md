To get your chatbot up and running, you just need a few minutes to get an API key and then connect it to your deployed app.

Step 1: Get an OpenRouter API Key
Sign In: Navigate to OpenRouter and sign in to your account. You can create a new account if you don't have one.

Access API Keys: Go to the API Keys page from your profile or the dashboard.

Create a New Key: Click the "Create a new key" button. A new API key will be generated for you.

Copy the Key: Be sure to copy this key immediately! It will only be shown to you once.
